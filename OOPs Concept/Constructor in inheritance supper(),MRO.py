#When we search for an attribute in a class that is involved in python 
#multiple inheritance, an order is followed. First, it is searched in the
#current class. If not found, the search moves to parent classes. This is
#left-to-right, depth-first

#So, in the above class, the search order will be â€“ Child, Mother, Father, Object.

# Algorithm:

# 1. Build an inheritance graph such that the children point at the parents (you'll have to imagine the arrows are there) and
#    keeping the correct left to right order. (I've marked methods that call super with ^)

#          A^
#       /  |  \
#     /    |    \
#   B^     C^    D^  I^
#        / | \  /   /
#       /  |  X    /   
#      /   |/  \  /     
#    E^    F^   G^
#     \    |    /
#       \  |  / 
#          H
# (In this example, A is a child of B, so imagine an edge going FROM A TO B)

# 2. Remove all classes that aren't eventually inherited by A

#          A^
#       /  |  \
#     /    |    \
#   B^     C^    D^

#    E^    F^   G^
#     \    |    /
#       \  |  / 
#          H

# 3. For each level of the graph from bottom to top
#       For each node in the level from right to left
#           Remove all of the edges coming into the node except for the right-most one
#           Remove all of the edges going out of the node except for the left-most one
